This is my first React project developed during my time at Assembler Institute of Technology. The project draws inspiration from leading brands such as Nike, Adidas, and Puma to create a sleek and intuitive user interface. However, the design primarily follows the rugged yet stylish aesthetic of The North Face brand.
